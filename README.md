# Coding the Bracken from Lethal Company - Unity Tutorial

This Unity project is based on the code featured in my YouTube video tutorial on how to code the Bracken, an enemy from the game Lethal Company. This project demonstrates the implementation of Bracken's mechanics and behavior in Unity, providing a foundation for creating similar AI-driven characters with unique environmental interactions.
